**Subject:** feat: Implement core architecture with tenant isolation and modules

BREAKING CHANGE: Complete restructure to support multi-tenancy

Core Infrastructure:

- Add Account model for tenant representation
- Implement TenantBaseModel with automatic tenant filtering
- Add TenantMiddleware for request-level tenant context
- Create UserProfile linking users to accounts with roles
- Implement role-based permissions (admin/manager/user)

Feature Modules:

- Documents module with file upload and S3 path isolation
- PM Templates module with AI-assisted generation support
- Risk Inspections module with findings and report generation

API Structure:

- Configure /api/v1/ versioned routing
- Add DRF viewsets with tenant-aware base classes
- Implement service layer pattern with DTOs
- Set up OpenAPI documentation at /api/v1/docs/

Security:

- Automatic tenant filtering via TenantManager
- Role-based access control on all endpoints
- Tenant-scoped S3 paths (tenants/{id}/module/...)

This implementation follows the documented architecture principles
with strict tenant isolation and modular code organization.
