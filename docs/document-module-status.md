# Document Management Module - Current Status

## Last Updated: September 1, 2025

### Current State
The Document Management Module has been implemented with a unified hierarchical tree view that displays folders and documents together. All major functionality is working but there are known performance and UX improvements that could be made.

### What's Working
1. **Hierarchical Tree View**
   - Folders and documents displayed in single unified view
   - Proper indentation (folders at level, documents one level deeper)
   - Expand/collapse functionality for folders
   - 11 folders with nesting up to 4 levels deep
   - 17 test documents properly organized

2. **Core Features**
   - Document upload (UI present, backend configured)
   - Folder creation with nesting
   - Sorting by name/date/size
   - File type icons with appropriate colors
   - Search functionality (UI present)
   - Sharing system (backend ready)

3. **Performance Optimizations Applied**
   - Client-side expand/collapse (instant response)
   - Eliminated unnecessary API calls
   - Background state saving
   - Optimized sorting algorithms
   - Loading indicators
   - Memoized computed properties

### Known Issues & Areas for Improvement
1. **Authentication**: Currently bypassed for testing - needs proper JWT implementation
2. **File Upload**: Actual file upload to S3/MinIO needs testing with real storage
3. **Search**: Frontend search implementation needs completion
4. **Sharing UI**: Share dialog and notifications panel need testing
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Not yet optimized for mobile devices
6. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation could be improved

### Technical Debt
1. **Temporary Solutions**:
   - `is_expanded` field added directly to Folder model (should use FolderUserState)
   - Anonymous user handling throughout views.py
   - Mock S3 URLs in development

2. **Code Cleanup Needed**:
   - Remove console.log statements
   - Add proper TypeScript types for TreeItem interface
   - Implement proper error handling for failed API calls
   - Add unit tests for components and store

### API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/folders/` - Folder CRUD operations
- `/api/v1/files/` - Document operations (note: "files" not "documents")
- `/api/v1/shares/` - Document sharing
- `/api/v1/notifications/` - Share notifications

### Database Schema
- Added `is_expanded` field to Folder model (migration 0003)
- Document model has nullable `s3_version_id` (migration 0002)
- Test data created via `create_test_documents.py` script

### Frontend Architecture
- **Store**: Pinia store at `documentsStore.ts`
- **Components**:
  - `DocumentRepository.vue` - Main container
  - `DocumentTree.vue` - Tree structure builder
  - `DocumentTreeItem.vue` - Individual item renderer
  - Supporting dialogs for upload, folder creation, sharing

### Recent Performance Fixes
1. Removed API call on every folder expand/collapse
2. Eliminated document fetching on folder selection
3. Added loading states during initialization
4. Optimized sorting to filter first, then sort
5. Implemented instant UI updates with background saves

### Next Steps
1. Implement proper authentication flow
2. Complete S3/MinIO integration for real file storage
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Implement search functionality
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Optimize for mobile devices
7. Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
8. Remove temporary authentication bypasses

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py test modules.documents

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run test

# Create test data
cd backend
python create_test_documents.py
```

### Environment Notes
- Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
- Using PostgreSQL for database
- MinIO configured but not required for basic testing
